What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?

## Technical Challenges / Research

 - Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges
 - What did you learn

*Wevent* is a responsive web application that allows users to create and view events on a calendar  based their location. Users can search for events by applying  filters based on their location (city, state), category type, number of attendees, private / public , or the cost of an event. Users can choose whether or not to attend and event or just as easily create a new event with similar filters

## Client Deliverables 

Our team developed the following user stories to track deliverables and meet the expectations of our client

## User Stories

Login / Signup
 - Users can login with username and password.
 - User signs up with a display name, password, city, and state.

Filter
 - Users can filter events by category.
 - Users can filter events by distance.
 - Users can filter events by # of people. 
 - Users can filter events by cost.
 - Users can filter events by a keyword. 
 - Users can filter events by duration.
 - Users can filter events by the time of day.
 - Users can filter events by private/public.
 - Users can filter events by the event location.
 - Users can filter events by open/closed status.

Dashboard
 - Users can view events by hosting / attending status. View in a list format.
 - Users location is displayed.
 - Users can click on an event in the list and link to event info.
 - Users should be able to view the dashboard button.

Create Event
 - Users can access a form to create a new event.
 - When a user submits a new event, that event appears on the calendar.
 - Users can click on an event in the list and link to event info.
 - User inputs are Name, Date, location, price, time, duration, description, category private/public, max people.

Calendar
 - Users logs in and sees a month calendar of displayed events by location(lat/long)
 - Users can change the display of the calendar by month, week or day.
 - Calendar displays events based on filter
 - User can filter events by category, distance, # of people, cost, keyword, duration/time, private/public event



## Tech Stack

Front End:
- React
- Material UI
- SASS

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express
- mySQL

Deployment/Testing:
- Jest/Supertest
- Docker
- AWS EC2

## Technical Challenges / Research

Challenge
 - 1. Allow the user to filter events on the calendar in real time by six different metrics.
 - 2. Display only the event information that the user is allowed to see based on their permissions status (host, full access, or limited access)
 - 3. Allow users to request to join a private event (get full access). Allow user to accept or reject this request

Implementatation
 - 1. Logging in automatically populates the calendar with all events in the user's area by setting each metric in the filter to a default. When the user moves the filter, a new database call is automatically triggered.
 - 2. When the server is notified that a user has clicked an event, it first determines what information that user has access to. It then makes one of three database calls (event info for host, full access, or limited access) and sends only the appropriate information back to the front end.
 - 3. Users attending or interested in an event are tracked in a join table that stores a user id, event id, and pending boolean. The latter describes the current status of the user's relationship to that event. It is true if the user is pending approval, false if they are approved, and the realtionship is non-existant if the user has not submitted a request or has been rejected.



### Development Workflow
Our team managed workflow and responsibilities by utilizing Agile methodology. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/JIxuLxiP/blue-ocean) was used to to keep track of tickets. All development work was specifically associated with a ticket. At any point in time the status of a ticket could be ascertained by finding it on the board. After our daily standup meeting we assessed the status of our application then updated and reassigned tickets based on workload.

## Version Control and Continuous Integration

Our team utilized git feature branch workflow to ensure our master branch always contained working code. Our master and development branches blocked direct pushes of new code. Instead, developers would create feature branches off the development branch, then create pull requests into development upon completion of that feature.
All pull requests required review by another developer prior to merging new features into development. Our team utilized Travis CI for continuous integration. We integrated Travis with GitHub, allowing reviewers to easily ensure the branch they were reviewing had passed our testing suite. Pull requests with failed tests were barred from merging, and required the developer who opened the request to resolve the issue. The development branch was only merged into master after significant testing and approval by the entire team. This ensured our deployed build was never broken.

## Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.

Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
What did you learn from the process
What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
Writing tests
Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?

Future refactoring?
Additional dev ops considerations?
UI/UX additions?
